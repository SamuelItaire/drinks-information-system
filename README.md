This is a Java project (built with IntelliJ IDEA) for storing and retrieving information on drinks and their ingredients. It demonstrates custom data structures and algorithms, with no reliance on Java’s built-in collections. Features include:

Add/edit/delete drinks and ingredients

Associate drinks with recipes (ingredients + quantities)

Search drinks/ingredients (by name, keyword, ABV, etc.)

Sort search results (alphabetically or by alcohol content)

Custom hashing for efficient lookups

Interactive navigation (drill down from drink → ingredient → related drinks)

Persistence (saving/loading to file)

JavaFX GUI for user interaction

JUnit tests for validation
